		<h2>Blog Post #1: Predictive Physics (Projectiles)</h2>
		
		<p>December 9th, 2019</p>
		<p>
			You know those games at carnivals where you have to throw a softball at a moving target, like a cutout of a rubber duck or an alien or something? 
			Before you throw the ball, do you calculate the velocity of the target, take into account the earth’s gravity, and adjust the velocity and trajectory 
			of your throw based off of that? Well... yes, but it’s likely not something that comes as a conscious effort on your part, or really requires an in-depth 
			understanding of the mathematics and physics that are involved in the process. Computers, on the other hand, aren’t as sophisticated. 
			In order to realistically portray an artificially intelligent Non-Player Character in the game you’re developing, you’re going to need to put in the algorithms for Predictive Physics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether its a Single-Player Action Game, a multiplayer First-Person Shooter, a Massively Online Battle Arena, or even a sports game like Hockey or Football,
			realistic behavior and physics will be what separates an “artificially intelligent” NPC from an NPC whose football throw/gun fire/grenade toss gets posted on 
			Twitter with a caption that reads “?????”. Any game in which some sort of projectile or object needs to make contact with a moving target will need these kinds of algorithms. 
			One easy way to visualize this interception is to imagine a series of circles emanating from both the turret and the target (at its current position). 
			Those spaces where the circles touch each other would be the most optimal places to fire. 
			<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37250215/intersection-of-two-moving-objects-with-latitude-longitude-coordinates">One user on StackOverflow</a> visualized this beautifully:
		</p>
		<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAXyO.png">
		<p>
			I’ll explain the concept and the mathematics behind it using my own code as an example.
		</p>
		<img src="../GameScreenshotExplained2.png">
		<p>
			In my game, you control the black dot by clicking on the screen, and the black arrow will follow you around. 
			The red dot is a turret, placed by pressing the ‘t’ key, which will activate when the player comes within its range 
			(approximately 150 pixels squared). Upon activation, it will predict the path of the player based on their current position and velocity 
			(speed and direction) and fire a projectile (both of whose paths are illustrated by the blue arrows,) which will intercept the player if 
			do not move off of their current path. The red Plus Shape in the bottom corner is a randomly-moving health kit, which is irrelevant to this demonstration. 
		</p>
		<img src="../GameScreenshotExplained.png">
		<p>
			In this picture, as you can see, the green arrow has been fired in the direction that the black arrow would follow if it continued in its same path. 
			In the event the fired projectile misses, it will disappear in three seconds and the turret will be ready to fire again. 
			The targeting mathematics are mostly handled in the TurretOnState, which is a state for the Turret to be in. 
			Should the player enter an inactive turret’s range, the On State will be triggered, and the projectile will be fired. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s take a look at the code:

		</p>
		<p>
			First, we need to get the necessary information prepared. 
			We need the Projectile Speed, the Target’s Speed, the Distance between the Turret and the Target, and the Target Velocity.
		</p>
		<img src="../CodeSample1.png">
		<p>
			Things get a little bit easier if the projectile and the target have the same speed. 
		</p>
		<img src="../CodeSample2.png">
		<p>
			Otherwise, use the Quadratic Formula to save time. The ‘x’ in our case is t, or Time it will take for the projectile to reach its mark.
		</p>
		<img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/googleusercontent/nI2riiPBcl9hZ22KKdYZGFmsVNhcKLiuwPly9l1tU5BMaqcOs9bfPKRyoGAFgK-PNpc-c7x_tNuskGdzawvy_Pza">
		<img src="../CodeSample3.png">
		<p>
			Since, obviously, time flows in one direction (forward), and realistically speaking, things take time to move places, it wouldn’t make much 
			sense for our t to be either equal to or lower than Epsilon 0. Since the quadratic formula has both +/- possibilities, we’ll take the smaller 
			of the two, provided it is not equal to or lower than Epsilon 0. (Epsilon Zero is “the permittivity of free space”, a somewhat hard concept to 
			describe, but in this case, we’re using it as an absolute smallest baseline of how much time can be taken to move from one place to another). 
			It is also entirely possible that no solution may be found. Perhaps the target is moving incredibly fast and the projectile could not catch up. 
			In this case, the time would be set to 1 second, telling the turret to fire where the player will be in one second (which likely will not hit), 
			and a flag is set informing the final piece of the code to make a special case for the unachievable target. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we calculate the velocity! To do that, take the player’s speed, and add the negative of the difference between the player’s starting 
			location and the turret over the time it would take to reach the destination. If the valid solution was not found and we’re stuck with the guess 
			value of one second, you can make this mistake look smoother and less suspicious by multiplying the normalized velocity with the projectile’s speed, 
			which should cause the turret to shoot in a generally correct direction.
		</p>
		<img src="../CodeSample4.png">
		<p>
			Now, we have the velocity of the projectile! Your projectile won’t really be ‘seeking’ a specific location like a unit would, but instead it is just 
			going in the direction you tell it to, until it either makes contact with the player or fizzles out after three seconds. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Should your game account for gravity, that would be taken into account after this. While my specific implementation of Predictive Projectile Physics does 
		not take gravity into account, being a two-dimensional top-down game, all you would have to do is subtract the gravity’s compensation from your projectile’s 
		velocity. Kain Shin, game developer and generally “cool dude”, in his code for predicting aim, implements this quite well by granting the projectile additional 
		acceleration upwards or downwards, depending on gravity’s force on it. You can view his code <a href="http://ringofblades.com/Blades/Code/PredictiveAim.cs">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Properly predicting your projectile’s physics can mean the difference between a  good-looking, realistic AI and a distractingly misbehaving AI. 
			This sort of technique is easily adaptable to both 3D and 2D games, and has many more uses than just projectiles. One really interesting use for 
			Predictive Physics I have read about in Artificial Intelligence For Games, Second Edition (written by Ian Millington and John Funge) is their 
			application in adjusting for network delays or disruptions. The network could adjust the positions of players they were unable to keep track of 
			during network lag by predicting where they would end up if they continued on their path and moving them there, subtly (or abruptly) moving them 
			back to the correct position once the connection has been re-established.
